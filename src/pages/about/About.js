              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Founded in 2012, FFL Gym started with a simple vision: to create
                a fitness space that feels like home. What began as a small
                local gym has grown into a thriving fitness community with over
                27,000 members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past 12 years, we've expanded our facilities, added
                cutting-edge equipment, and assembled a team of 117+ certified
                trainers who are dedicated to your success. But through all this
                growth, we've never lost sight of what matters most: you and
                your fitness journey.
